Use the packet sniffer tools wireshark: - a. Observer performance
in  non-promiscuous mode and Show how the packets can be traced based on different filters.

Theory:  Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer, or an application that captures packets from a network connection, such as from your computer to your home office or the internet. A packet is the name given to a discrete unit of data in a typical Ethernet network.
Wireshark is the most often-used packet sniffer in the world. Like any other packet sniffer, Wireshark does three things:
●     Packet Capture: Wireshark listens to a network connection in real-time and then grabs entire streams of traffic – quite possibly tens of thousands of packets at a time.
●     Filtering: Wireshark is capable of slicing and dicing all of this random live data using filters. By applying a filter, you can obtain just the information you need to see.
●     Visualization: Wireshark, like any good packet sniffer, allows you to dive right into the very middle of a network packet. It also allows you to visualize entire conversations and network streams.


Output:
a. Observer performance in promiscuous as well as non-promiscuous mode.
Conclusion: We have understood how wireshark works.
